# Console Memory Game

## Description

This project is a console-based memory game developed in C#. It allows two human players to play against each other by turns, or a human player to play against the computer. The game uses various Object-Oriented Programming concepts and demonstrates proficiency in C# and .NET.

## Objectives

- Implement Object-Oriented Programming concepts using classes.
- Utilize Constructors, Enums, Properties, Access Modifiers, and Modifiers.
- Work with Arrays/Collections/Data Structures.
- Use the String Class effectively.
- Reference External DLL (Assembly).

## Features

- Human vs. Human or Human vs. Computer gameplay.
- Dynamic board size selection (4x4 to 6x6).
- Score tracking for both players.
- AI-based computer opponent for more challenging gameplay.
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio
- .NET Framework
- Ex02.ConsoleUtils.dll file (included in the download package)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/console-memory-game.git
    ```

2. **Open the project** in Visual Studio.

3. **Add Reference to Ex02.ConsoleUtils.dll:**
   - Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer.
   - Select `Add > Reference`.
   - Click `Browse` and navigate to the location of `Ex02.ConsoleUtils.dll`.
   - Select the DLL and add it as a reference to the project.

### Running the Game

1. **Build the project** in Visual Studio.
2. **Run the executable** generated by Visual Studio.

## How to Play

1. **Enter player names:**
   - The user is prompted to enter their name (no spaces, max 20 chars).
   - If playing against another human, enter the opponent's name (no spaces, max 20 chars).

2. **Choose game mode:**
   - Select to play against a computer or another human player.

3. **Select board size:**
   - Choose board size (minimum 4x4, maximum 6x6).

4. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns choosing cells to expose.
   - If a matching pair is found, the pair remains exposed, and the player gains a point.
   - If a non-matching pair is found, the cells are hidden again after 2 seconds, and the turn passes to the opponent.
   - The game continues until all pairs are found.
   - The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.
   - Players can quit the game at any time by typing 'Q'.

## Architecture

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Demonstrates the use of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear separation between the UI and game logic.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive input validation and error handling using C# exceptions.
